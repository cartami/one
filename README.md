# one
My coding solution to the The One API https://the-one-api.dev/documentation using Spring Boot.

Using Maven model for project dependencies.
Use Spring WEB dependency since this will be a web application and not REST API.
There will be html responses using Thymeleaf. We can write HTML templates without having to create a front end using javascript and use on a browser.
Thymeleaf dependency gives you a templating library to render HTML.
Spring Boot DevTools for fast application restarts.
No database used, using GET requests to The ONE API (https://the-one-api.dev/documentation) and renders in a web format. Creating a UI skin for the data.
Taking in the data, parsing it and hook it into the Spring lifecycle and present in a nice format.
